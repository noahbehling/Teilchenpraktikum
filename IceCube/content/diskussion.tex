\section{Discussion}\label{sec:Durchf√ºhrung}
The errors of the values in table \ref{tab:results} are all of the same order of magnitude.
The best result in efficiency, purity and the jaccard index in table \ref{tab:results} was archieved with the Random Forest classifier while the ROC curve 
is also closest to the ideal curve. \\
It is clear from figure \ref{fig:ROC} that the second closest curve to the ideal curve is that of the kNN classifier while 
it archieves an efficiency above, a purity below and a jaccard index in table \ref{tab:results} above that of the Naive-Bayes classifier. 
The performance of the kNN classifier being so close to the Naive-Bayes classifier could be caused by the use of 
to many neighbours leading to to many classes in a bunch and leading to worse predictions. 
Therefore it would be interesting for further investigation if the used algorithm would perform better 
if the criterium for selecting the optimal number of used neighbours is changed. \\
Overall it is clear that the Random Forest classifier seperates the signal from the background most successfully 
and is therfore best fitted to the task, assuming that computing time does not play a role in the selection of the algorithm.
