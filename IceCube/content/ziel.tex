\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}
In this lab course neutrino selection with Monte-Carlo-simulated data from the IceCube neutrino observatory is done. To efficiently select neutrinos the data first need to be preprocessed. Afterwards a selection of attributes will be used for separation via machine learning algorithms.
