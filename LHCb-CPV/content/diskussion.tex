\section{Discussion}

Both for the simulated data in \autoref{f2}, as well as for the real data in \autoref{f4} a clear peak is visible at the B-mass in the
mass spectrum. The peak produced by real data is much wider since the simulated dataset is not distorted by the detector. Additionally
more Background events are visible in the real data since the simulated data does not contain background events. This is especially
prevelent in the lower sideband region of the signal. This effect in the lower sideband could be a result of a misidentification of final state
particles as kaons in calculation of the energy. \\

removal of the resonances have been determined by eye and could possibly be improved to achieve better results.

has a very high significance of $100 \sigma$, but is disregarded in the analysis since it only contains two $B^+$-candidates and no $B^-$-candidates.
in the bin investigated in the analysis a local \textit{CP}-asymmetry of $A_\textit{CP} = -0.20 \pm 0.03(stat)  \pm 0.01(prod)$ could be oberved 
with $6.53 \sigma$ and crosses therefore the threshold of obervation. The significance could possibly improved further if other bin- sizes and shapes are
investigated. This asymmetry is visible in the comparison of the mass spectra of $B^+$- and $B^-$-candidates in \autoref{f8}, where more
$B^+$-candidates are observed.
