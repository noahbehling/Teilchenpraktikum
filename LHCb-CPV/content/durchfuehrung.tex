\section{Analysis strategy}
\label{sec:Durchf√ºhrung}
In this analysis two datasets are used. One contains simulated $B^\pm \to K^\pm K^+ K^-$ decays while the other are LHCb measurements from 2011 with an integrated luminosity of $\SI{434}{\per\pico\barn}$ for the magnet's up polarity and $\SI{584}{\per\pico\barn}$ for the down polarity. The measurements were selected regarding the same decay and after further preselection by applying cuts on particle identification variables the global \textit{CP} violation in this data set is investigated. Charmonium resonances are removed from the data via mass cuts which are inferred from a Dalitz plot. The remaining data are analysed with respect to local \textit{CP} violation.
