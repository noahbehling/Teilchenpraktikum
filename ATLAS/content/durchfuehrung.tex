\section{Analysis strategy}
\label{sec:Durchf√ºhrung}
In this analysis, a search for $t\bar{t}$ resonances, caused by a hypothetical $Z\prime$ particle that decays into a $t\bar{t}$ pair, is performed. Since the \textit{all-hadronic} channel has a very large background contribution and the \textit{dilepton} channel has a very small branching fraction, only the \textit{lepton+jets} channel is considered in this analysis.
To account for neutrinos from the $W$ decays, missing transverse momentum is required. To distinguish between $b$ and light-hadron-jets,
$b$-tagging is used. For the distinction a displaced secondary vertex is important among other criteria.
An event selection is applied using these and additional criteria to increase the signal-to-background ratio.
To model the background contribution, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used.
To check the validity of the MC simulations, these are compared to data. In the end, a final discriminant is chosen and used in a statistical analysis to set limits on the cross sections of $Z\prime$ particles at different masses.
