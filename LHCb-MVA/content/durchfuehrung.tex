\section{Analysis strategy}
\label{sec:Durchf√ºhrung}
In the analysis three data samples are used. The first sample constists of real data from the LHCb experiment. The second and third data samples consist of 
the simulated decays $B_s^0 \rightarrow \psi(2S) B_s^0$ and $B^0 \rightarrow \psi(2S) K_s^0$. The first dataset is used to create a 
background dats sample from the upper sideband region of the mass $m(B_s^0)$. The second and third dataset are used as signal samples, 
where the decay $B^0 \rightarrow \psi(2S) K_s^0$ is iused as control channel.
