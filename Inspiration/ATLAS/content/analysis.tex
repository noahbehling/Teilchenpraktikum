\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Preselection}
To reduce the large amount of data, a lose preselection was applied to the dataset beforehand.
This preselection includes some requirements for each event.
Some of the given variables in the data sample have more entries that there are entries in the sample itself.
This is because events with more than one lepton or more than one jet have a seperate entry of variables connected to the leptons or jets.
Some triggers are applied to the data as well.
Since background leptons are difficult to seperate from signal leptons, a cut on the transversal momentum of the lepton is was made at $\SI{20}{\giga\electronvolt}$ to reduce combinatorial background.
This can be shown in the $\texttt{lep$\_$pt}$ of one of the data samples in figure \ref{fig:leppt}.
The pseudorapidity shows two areas ($|\eta|\approx 1.4$) with a very low amount of events.
In this area cables and other not detecting elements are placed so that the geometric acceptance of the detector is not at $100\,\%$.
The azimuth angle $\phi$ does not show any restrictions in the data set.
